## The mockup

http://emilie.watlock.be/redline-mockup.pdf

I used Pencil to design the mockup. It's user-friendly and very intuitive, but it's not very stable on my laptop (Linux Mint). I'll try another software next time.

## The making

1. Made with Bootstrap.
2. Toggle menu for smartphones and tablets
3. Use of cards for books on the homepage.
4. Cascading websites when clicking on Links.

## To be finished / improved

1. The Google map on the contact page is not yet responsive.
2. THe CSS code has not been optimized yet (html files have been checked via W3C Markup Validation)
3. I don't know how to associate an email to the "Submit" button of the contact form.
4. I couldn't find a good layout to present the books. 
5. I didn't manage to make the menu bar + side bar fixed. I didn't have time to look deeper, though.
6. The size of the title "Suzanne Collins" changes in Firefox but not in Chrome. I don't know how to fix it.

## Lessons learned

1. Next time I won't make to many proposals. For the contact page, I offered address, contact form, map, etc. Filip said yes to everything. :-)
2. Bootstrap is awesome but I use it too much in a "Russian dolls" way with grids, nested grids, nested grids in nested grids... It turned me crazy when I occasionally got lost.
3. I inserted too many comments in the html code, mostly because I was lost with all the div. I'll try to reduce them next time.
4. I didn't "git push" often enough.
