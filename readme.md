# Red Line Project: Suzanne Collins Website

## Comparison

* Official website: http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/
* My facelift: https://meulymooh.github.io/suzanne-collins/index.html

## The schedule
* 27/02/2019: First appointment with Filip to define the content and layout of the home, contact and book pages.
* 04/03/2019: Presentation of 2 mockups.
* 18/03/2019: Delivery.

* Minutes of meeting: http://emilie.watlock.be/Minutes.pdf

## The mockup

* Download it here: http://emilie.watlock.be/redline-mockup.pdf
* I used Pencil to design the mockup. It's user-friendly and very intuitive, but it's not very stable on my laptop (Linux Mint). I'll try another software next time.

## The making

* Made with Bootstrap.
* Toggle menu for smartphones and tablets
* Use of cards for books on the homepage.
* Cascading websites when clicking on Links.

## To be finished / improved

* The CSS code has not been fully optimized yet (html files have been checked via W3C Markup Validation)
* I don't know how to associate an email to the "Submit" button of the contact form.
* I'm not really happy with the layout of the book page. 
* I didn't manage to make the menu bar + side bar fixed (not reloading every time I click on a new page). I didn't have time to look deeper, though.
* The size of the title "Suzanne Collins" changes from one page to the other in Firefox, but not in Chrome. I don't know how to fix this.

## Lessons learned

* Next time I won't offer too many options during the first meeting with the coach and let the client make more proposals.
* Bootstrap is awesome but my code looks like "Russian dolls" (grids, nested grids, nested grids in nested grids...). It made me crazy and I occasionally got lost.
* I inserted too many comments in the html code, mostly because I was lost with all the DIVs. I'll try to reduce them next time.
* I didn't "git push" often enough.
